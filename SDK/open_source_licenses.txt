        combination of the Original Code with other software or devices,
        including but not limited to Modifications.

3.0 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

3.1 Application of License.
The Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under
the terms of this License or a future version of this License released
under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every
copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. Your license
for shipment of the Contributor Version is conditioned upon Your full
compliance with this Section. The Modifications which You create must
comply with all requirements set out by the Standards body in effect one
hundred twenty (120) days before You ship the Contributor Version. In the
event that the Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to
publish either (i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting
from implementation of Your Modifications and a reference implementation
of Your Modifications or (ii) Your Modifications in Source Code form, and
to make any such deviation and reference implementation or Modifications
available to all third parties under the same terms as this license on a
royalty free basis within thirty (30) days of Your first customer shipment
of Your Modifications. Additionally, in the event that the Modifications
you create do not meet the requirements set out in this Section, You
agree to comply with the Standards requirements set out in Exhibit B.

3.2 Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may
add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You
must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code
where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
Your version of the Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely
clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result
of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source form only if
the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that Original
Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version
of the Original Code is available under the terms of this License. The
notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable or
Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
recipients' rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the
Executable and Source versions of Your version of the Code or ownership
rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
of this License. If You distribute the Executable and Source versions
under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
Initial Developer. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of any
such terms You offer.

3.4 Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with other code
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code.

4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included
in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must be included with
all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited
by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5.0 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
the notice in Exhibit A and to related Modifications as set out in
Section 3.1.

6.0 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE

6.1 New Versions.
Initial Developer may publish revised and/or new versions of the License
from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
number.

6.2 Effect of New Versions.
Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of
the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the
terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial
Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify
the terms applicable to Original Code.

7.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

ORIGINAL CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE ORIGINAL CODE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY ORIGINAL CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY ORIGINAL CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER
EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.0 TERMINATION

8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
sublicenses to the Original Code which are properly granted shall survive
any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2 In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all end user
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
shall survive termination.

9.0 LIMIT OF LIABILITY

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER,
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with

this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and

hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims

asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such

warranty or additional liability.
